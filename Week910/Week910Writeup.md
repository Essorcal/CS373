# Week 9 - Mobile Security

## Intro

This weeks discussion was about mobile security specifically android security but we touched on iOS and other mobile operating systems as well as the history of mobile security. The mobile phone industry has exploded not only in terms of size but also in complexity and technology involved.  Once phones started getting "smart" features and full operating systems there were many competing players in the market from Blackberry, Windows, etc... However over the last few years Android and iOS are the only real players left in the smartphone market with android having the lionshare of the market.
