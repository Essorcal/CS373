# Week 9 - Mobile Security

## Intro

This weeks discussion was about mobile security specifically android security but we touched on iOS and other mobile operating systems as well as the history of mobile security. The mobile phone industry has exploded not only in terms of size but also in complexity and technology involved.  Once phones started getting "smart" features and full operating systems there were many competing players in the market from Blackberry, Windows, etc... However over the last few years Android and iOS are the only real players left in the smartphone market with android having the lionshare of the market.

## History

Motorola invented the first experimental cell phone back in 1973 and released the first commercially available cell phone in 1984.  These phones ran on the analog cell phone network AMPS also designated as (1G) as it was the first generation cell phone network.

As shown in the above graph charting the evolution of the cell phone network you can see how and why the complexity of mobile security has gotten vastly more complicated in a few short decades.  Going from analog signals where the worst that could be done was either cloning of phones to steal minutes and make calls on someone else's account or jamming of the signal to prevent mobile phone conversations.  From there once the networks went digital both additional security was added as well as the addition of malware and additional security in the form of encryption and jamming resistance.
