# Week 7 - Web Security

## Intro

This week the focus was on web security which is an extremely important subject as can be seen in the news it seems like most weeks in terms of hacks, breaches and loss of consumer data. Web security encompasses all layers of the internet from the client's browser to the websites and servers of the internet at large. Malware/exploitation has evolved considerably over the last 25 years or so.  In the beginning it was basic phishing in terms of simple email and website scams designed to get people to give up their credit card numbers and popup based malware that tried to trick the user into clicking on something blatant on the screen that would lead them to a malicious site.  Over time more and more sophisticated malware was developed in terms of extremely targeted phishing, zero day browser exploits and web technology exploits like java, flash, HTML5.
