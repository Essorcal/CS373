# Week 5 - Windows Internals

## Intro

This week's material was all about going down into the depths of the bowels of windows into the kernel and memory manipulation/management.  I'll be honest this weeks material has been the most difficult for me to wrap my head around as I haven't had any experience working with the kernel.  Trying to understand what all is going on at the lower levels of the machine and learning how even anti-virus providers were not taking tracking/watching for exploits targeting that layer until the mid 2000's put into perspective how complicated the relationship is between the kernel and potential malware that can be hidden there.
