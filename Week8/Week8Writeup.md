# Week 8 - Messaging - Security Tools and Techniques

## Intro

This week the focus was on primarily email security but in a broader sense it covered messaging security in general such as the classification of spam and phishing emails.  Email security is so important because of how ubiquitious a form of communication it has become with people having multiple email accounts for work and personal use giving potential bad actors many different attack vectors to reach a targeted single person or large groups of people.

## Spam vs Ham

In the industry ham is considered legitmate email while according to Kaspersky Labs "the definition of spam is anonymous, unsolicited bulk email." In addition to just being annoying spam can have much more malicious contents or objectives.  Especially when it comes to phishing emails which are spam messages specifically designed to trick the receipient into believing the source was a legitmate friend/business/etc... instead it is a bad actor that tries to steal information/data with an email designed to look like a real email.
